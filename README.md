# Algorithms_FS24
This repository contains an environment to practice the implementation of sorting algorithms that have been introduced in the lecture "Algorithm and Data Structures" at the University of Basel in Spring Semester 2024. The java implementations and tests are done by me.
The material for graph algorithms is summarized by @gioialm, the contents on graph algorithms may have been partly or fully taken from lecture slides or similar.
