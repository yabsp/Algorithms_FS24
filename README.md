# Algorithms_FS24
This repository contains an environment to practice the implementation of sorting algorithms that have been introduced in the lecture "Algorithm and Data Structures" at the University of Basel in Spring Semester 2024. 

## Content
The folder [sorting](sorting/) contains java implementations of sorting algorithms. These java implementations and the according [tests](sorting\src\test\java\SortingTest.java) are written by me.
The material for the [graph](graph/) algorithms is summarized by @gioialm, the contents on graph algorithms may have been partly or fully taken from lecture slides or similar.

## Remark
These contents are from Spring Semester 2024 and may not be congruent with current lecture material. Please consider this when looking at them.
